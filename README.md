### Overview
The presentation is based on the [research paper by H. Herath, P. Kumar and A. Amershi](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12197-011-9171-1).

The analysis was performed on real Heating Oil and Crude Oil pricing data. We present how the assumptions of the classical approach which employs a two-dimensional correlated Geometric Brownian Motions break down when applied to real data. Different parametric copula families are described and fitted to the dependency structure and marginal distributions are estimated and analyzed.

Then we present a Monte Carlo based pricing of crack spread options under the selected model.
